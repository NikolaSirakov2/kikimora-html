# HTML Header Include - No JavaScript Required

Since HTML doesn't have native include functionality, here are several approaches to include the header across all pages without using JavaScript:

## Option 1: Server-Side Includes (SSI) - Recommended
If your web server supports SSI (Apache, Nginx), you can use:

```html
<!--#include virtual="includes/header.html" -->
```

**Pros:** 
- No JavaScript required
- Server-side processing
- SEO friendly

**Cons:** 
- Requires server support
- Won't work with static hosting

## Option 2: Build Tools / Static Site Generators
Use tools like:
- **Gulp** with `gulp-file-include`
- **Grunt** with `grunt-include-replace`
- **Hugo, Jekyll, or other static generators**

Example with Gulp:
```javascript
// gulpfile.js
const fileinclude = require('gulp-file-include');

gulp.task('fileinclude', function() {
  return gulp.src(['src/*.html'])
    .pipe(fileinclude({
      prefix: '@@',
      basepath: '@file'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./'));
});
```

Then in HTML:
```html
@@include('includes/header.html')
```

## Option 3: PHP Include (if using PHP)
```php
<?php include 'includes/header.html'; ?>
```

## Option 4: Copy and Paste Method
For small projects, simply copy the header content to each file manually.

## Option 5: Template System
Use a simple template system or build process that processes your HTML files before deployment.

## Recommendation
For your current setup, I recommend:
1. **If using Apache/Nginx:** Use SSI with `<!--#include virtual="includes/header.html" -->`
2. **If using static hosting:** Set up a simple build process with Gulp
3. **For quick solution:** Use the copy-paste method until you can implement a build system

The header file is ready at `includes/header.html` and can be used with any of these methods.
